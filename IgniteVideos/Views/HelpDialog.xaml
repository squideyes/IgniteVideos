                application should be should be fairly easy to use, but if you don't find that to be so, 
                please watch the video

                The basic idea is to find a session that you'd like to watch, and then to either 
                "Download &amp;  Play" or "Stream."  You can also click on an "Info" button to be 
                taken to the session's Ignite page, where you will find additional material such as 
                show notes, links and presentations.
                <LineBreak />
                <LineBreak />
                To download a video, click it's checkbox 
                (next to the Play button) and then click the Download button to save
                the video to your {MyDocuments}\IgniteVideos folder.  When the download 
                is finished, the video's Play button will light up and may be clicked. NOTE: 
                <Span FontStyle="Italic">Multiple videos may be downloaded at a single go</Span>
            <LineBreak />
                <LineBreak />
                The sessions shown in the grid may be filtered in a variety of ways.  For a 
                start, you can type text in the "Filter-Text" textbox.  The grid may be further 
                filtered by the values in the "Filter" and/or "Session-Type" comboboxes.  
                It's a good idea to click the heart-shaped Favorite button next to all of 
                the videos you're interested in and then to select the "Favorites" item in the 
                Filter combobox.  With nearly 600 videos to watch and/or download, filtering 
                the grid to only show your favorites makes the entire process easier.
