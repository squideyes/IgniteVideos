The  **IgniteVideos** application should be should be fairly easy to use, but if you don't find that to be so, please watch the video <a href="http://somesite.com/walthrough" target="_blank">walkthrough</a>.
                
The basic idea is to find a session that you'd like to watch, and then to either "**Download &amp;  Play**" or "**Stream**."  You can also click on an "**Info**" button to be taken to the session's Ignite page, where you will find additional material such as show notes, links and presentations.

To download a video, click it's checkbox (next to the Play button) and then click the Download button to save the video to your ""\{MyDocuments}\IgniteVideos" folder.  When the download is finished, the video's Play button will light up and may be clicked. *NOTE: Multiple videos may be downloaded at a single go.*
                
The sessions shown in the grid may be filtered in a variety of ways.  For a start, you can type text in the "Filter-Text" text-box.  The grid may be further filtered by the selecting values in the "Filter" and/or "Session-Type" combo-boxes.  
                
It's a good idea to click the heart-shaped Favorite button next to all of the videos you're interested in and then to select the "Favorites" item in the Filter combo-box.  With nearly 600 videos to stream and/or download, filtering the grid to only show your favorites makes the entire process much easier.
